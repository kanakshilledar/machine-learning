## Hand Written Digit Recognition

In this python project we are going to use the MNIST dataset for training Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. Each image is of a dimension `28 x 28` total `784 pixels`.

After training we will provide a live feed from the webcam as an image for detection.

##### Dependencies
`Python 3.x installed latest version is preffered` <br>
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
##### Usage
`python3 train.py`<br>
`python3 interface.py`

The project is split into two file one is
- interface.py
- train.py

For dependencies please see requirements.txt

This project needs some more refining. I have trained upto 80 epochs and its giving an accuracy of `0.9250002`.
This was my first try in doing any project using deep learning!
